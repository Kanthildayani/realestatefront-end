## 🛠️ Integration Tips

* Replace static content with dynamic data using templating (e.g., EJS, Handlebars)
* Fetch real data through API calls (REST or GraphQL) to populate pages
* Add CSS and utilities with frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or SASS
* Enable client-side interactivity using vanilla JS or frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
* Hook up authentication, payment gateways, and database once backend is ready
